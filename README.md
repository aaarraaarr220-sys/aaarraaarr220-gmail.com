DontKillMyApp is a tool for benchmarking nonstandard background processing limitations that are done by OEMs on different Android flavours. You can measure before setting up your phone, then go through the setup guides and benchmark again to see how much has your phone been slacking in the background.

You can share your report through the app to the maintainers of the dontkillmyapp.com website who compile it and base the overall negative score on it.

## How does the benchmark work?

The app starts a foreground service with a wake lock and schedules repetitive task on the main thread, a custom thread executor and schedules regular alarms (`AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`). Then it calculates executed vs. expected. That's it!
